import { CardGrid, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

skin overrides supports many versions of minecraft, going back to 1.14.4. versions before 1.19.4 do not have the ui, and the mod can only be used by [modifying the files yourself](/skin-overrides/advanced/). from 1.19.4 onwards, the mod has [networking abilities](/skin-overrides/usage/#server-support).

here are the update drops the mod supports:

|               drop | version | from  | to  | ui? | server? |
