## for skin artists

this mod was created in order to instantly preview skins from within the game. to do this, you just need to export the skin texture from your software (eg [blockbench](https://blockbench.net/)), like this:

<Steps>

1.  go to the [.minecraft folder](https://minecraft.wiki/w/.minecraft).

2.  open (or create) the `skin_overrides` folder.

    <FileTree>

    - .minecraft
      - **skin_overrides/**

    </FileTree>

3.  <Tabs syncKey="editor">
      <TabItem label="blockbench">
        right-click the texture you're using in the sidebar, and press "save
        as". from there, navigate to your `skin_overrides` folder, naming it
        `[username].[slim or wide]`. for example, if i (oriifu) was testing a
        slim skin, i would call it `oriifu.slim`, which saves it like this:
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="aseprite">
        go to file > save as, then navigate to your `skin_overrides` folder. if
        you aren't able to do that, you can copy your ase/png file to the
        `skin_overrides` folder instead, then open that in aseprite. you should
        name your file `[username].[slim or wide].png`. for example, if i
        (oriifu) was testing a slim skin, i would call it `oriifu.slim.png`,
        which saves it like this:
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="gimp">
        export (ctrl+shift+E) your texture into the `skin_overrides` folder,
        naming it `[username].[slim or wide].png`. for example, if i (oriifu)
        was testing a slim skin, i would call it `oriifu.slim.png`, like this:
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="other">
        save your skin texture into the `skin_overrides` folder, naming it
        `[username].[slim or wide].png`. for example, if i (oriifu) was testing
        a slim skin, i would call it `oriifu.slim.png`, like this:
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    <FileTree>

    - .minecraft
      - skin_overrides
        - **oriifu.slim.png**

    </FileTree>

    <Aside type="tip">

    you can put any username or uuid in the name. you can also omit `wide`, as it's the default. examples:

    - `steve.png` (applies a wide skin to the player Steve)
    - `f369e23f-ed67-4f6a-8e79-4a2ca148691a.slim.png` (applies a slim skin to me)
    - `6a5acc4839004c169c73bd9c7eb0087e.wide.png` (applies a wide skin to rai)

    </Aside>

4.  <Tabs syncKey="editor">
      <TabItem label="blockbench">
        to update your skin in game, simply save.
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="aseprite">
        to update your skin in game, simply save. (note that this will save as a
        png, not ase.)
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="gimp">
        to update your skin in game, simply re-export the texture (ctrl+E).
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="other">
        to update your skin in game, simply save the texture.
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    you don't need to run a command or do a resource reload--the skin will update automagically!

</Steps>

if you also want to get another player's perspective, you can use a mod like [freecam](https://modrinth.com/mod/XeEZ3fK2) to separate your camera from your body, or [carpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/releases) to create fake players (`/player [name] spawn`) which you can also override the skins of.
