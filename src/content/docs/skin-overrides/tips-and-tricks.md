## using when creating skins

i created this mod to have an easy way to instantly preview skins from within the game. the actual art can be made in software like [blockbench](https://blockbench.net/). the quickly update your in-game skin, go to the [.minecraft folder](https://minecraft.wiki/w/.minecraft), opening (or creating) the folder called `skin_overrides`, and exporting skin images here. to apply it in-game, name the file "[your username].[slim or wide].png". for example, if i (oriifu) was testing a slim skin, i would call it `oriifu.slim.png`. of course, you can replace the username with any name (or uuid) you desire. no commands or resource reloads are needed--the skin will update automagically!

if you also want to get another player's perspective, you can use a mod like [freecam](https://modrinth.com/mod/freecam) to separate your camera from your body, or [carpet](https://modrinth.com/mod/carpet) to create fake players (`/player [name] spawn`) which you can also override the skins of.
