import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

this page has information on how to manually modify skin or cape overrides, rather than using the ui.

skin overrides are stored in `.minecraft/skin_overrides`, and cape overrides are stored in `.minecraft/cape_overrides`.

<FileTree>

- .minecraft
  - skin_overrides contains all your skin override files
    - library contains your library textures
      - example.png
      - ...
    - library.json the library's definition
    - example.png the actual overrides
    - example.txt
    - ...
  - cape_overrides contains all your cape override files
    - library
      - example.png
      - ...
    - library.json
    - example.png
    - example.txt
    - ...

</FileTree>

## overrides format

overrides are stored in the `skin_overrides` or `cape_overrides` folders. they can either be a `txt` file or a `png` file.

to identify a player, a file name must include a player id. a player id can be one of the following:

- the player's username (case does not matter) (eg `oriifu`)
- the player's uuid (case and hyphens do not matter) (eg `f369e23f-ed67-4f6a-8e79-4a2ca148691a`)

### `png` files

a `png` override simply replaces the skin/cape texture with the file. files should be called `[id].png`, or `[id].[model].png` to specify a model (`wide` or `slim`).

for skins, files will be processed like other skins. this means, for instance, if you have a legacy pre-1.8 skin, you can use it, and the game will upgrade it just like it would any other skin.

<FileTree>

- skin_overrides
  - ORIIFU.png overrides oriifu's skin with this image (defaults to wide model)
  - ix0rai.slim.png overrides ix0rai's skin with this image (slim model)
  - thonkman.wide.png overrides Thonkman's skin with this image (wide model)
- cape_overrides
  - oriifu.png overrides oriifu's cape

</FileTree>

### `txt` files

`txt` files are always named `[id].png` and contain a namespaced id. different namespaces will have different functionalities. the supported namespaces are:

- `skin_overrides` -- uses the skin/cape from the library with the given id. if the id doesn't exist, nothing will happen.

for example, this file will use the library entry with the id `library_id_here`:

```
// skin_overrides/oriifu.txt
skin_overrides:library_id_here
```

## library format

the `library.json` file in either the skin or cape overrides folders contains a list of library objects:

| key       | type     | description                                               | required          |
| --------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `name`    | `string` | the name of the library entry. will be shown in the ui.   | yes               |
| `id`      | `string` | the id of the library entry. should be any unique string. | yes               |
| `file`    | `string` | the name of a file in the library folder.                 | yes, or `texture` |
| `texture` | `string` | the namespaced id of a texture.                           | yes, or `file`    |
| `model`   | `string` | for skins. either `wide` or `slim`.                       | skins only        |

here is an example library file:

<FileTree>

- skin_overrides
  - library
    - some_skin.png
  - library.json
  - oriifu.txt

</FileTree>

```json
// library.json
[
  {
    "name": "my skin",
    "id": "my_awesome_skin",
    "file": "some_skin.png",
    "model": "slim"
  },
  {
    "name": "Steve",
    "id": "steve",
    "texture": "minecraft:textures/entity/player/wide/steve.png",
    "model": "wide"
  }
]
```

to use the skins, reference them from an [override txt file](#txt-files) with the `skin_overrides` namespace:

```
// oriifu.txt
skin_overrides:my_awesome_skin
```

the images used in the library (for the `file` key) are stored in the `library` folder, under the respective overrides folder.

the library file is reloaded every time the library screen is opened, or every 2 seconds.
