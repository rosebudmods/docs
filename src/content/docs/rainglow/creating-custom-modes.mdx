This article explains how to make a custom mode through JSON.

It includes both a tutorial and full documentation on JSON properties and available colours.

## tutorial

The first step to creating a rainglow data pack is establishing the directory structure. Your normal data pack looks like this:

<FileTree>

- data
  - minecraft
    - ... most content found here
- pack.mcmeta metadata for your pack
- pack.png the icon for your pack

</FileTree>

We're going to be creating a new folder in `data` named `rainglow`, where rainglow related files go. Inside this folder we'll be creating another named `custom_modes`, from which rainglow discovers data. All files ending with `.json` in this folder will be loaded.

Our structure now looks like this:

<FileTree>

- data
  - minecraft/ this folder is not used in our data pack, it can simply be deleted
  - **rainglow**
    - **custom_modes**
      - ... rainglow mode jsons go here!
- pack.mcmeta metadata for your pack
- pack.png the icon for your pack

</FileTree>

Now, we get to the fun part: creating your mode! For this tutorial, our goal is to make a mode with the colours of a sunset.

In your `custom_modes` folder, create a new file for our custom mode. It can be called anything, as long as it's a `.json` file. Our file will be named `sunset.json`.

```json
// sunset.json
{
  "id": "sunset",
  "textColour": "E07000",
  "colourIds": ["red", "orange", "yellow", "pink", "purple", "indigo", "purple"]
}
```

To break down this file, we have three properties:

- `id`: the name of your mode. This can only contain lowercase letters and underscores. Examples: `lesbian_pride`, `monochrome`, `rainbow`.
- `textColour`: the colour of the text for your mode, in hex format. This is the colour of the text shown on the config screen. Colour pickers, such as [the one built-in to Google](https://google.com/search?q=color%20picker), will be helpful.
- `colourIds`: an array of colours that will be included in your mode. These are in the format of colour ids, which denote colours built into the mod. A full list of available colours can be found [here](/rainglow/reference/#available-colours).

Finally, you need to add translations for your custom mode. This has to be done through a resource pack, which is defined on the client. If you're implementing a custom mode on your server, this will have to be sent to the client when they log in. Documentation on this can be found [here](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorials/Creating_a_resource_pack#Server_resource_packs).

Your resource pack should have a structure like this:

<FileTree>

- assets
  - rainglow
    - lang
      - en_us.json an english language file
- pack.mcmeta metadata for your pack
- pack.png the icon for your pack

</FileTree>

Inside your language file, you can then define your mode's name using a key in the format `"rainglow.mode.[id]"`. For our sunset example, the language file will look like this:

```json
// en_us.json
{
  "rainglow.mode.sunset": "Sunset"
}
```

Now when referring to our sunset mode, its name will be shown as "Sunset".

Finally, place your datapack and resource pack inside minecraft's `datapacks` and `resourcepacks` folders respectively.

With that: You're done! You have now created a custom mode, and it can be selected in game and used.
